This project simulates churn analysis for a fictional B2B SaaS company. The company provides subscription-based software with three plans: \*\*Basic, Pro, and Enterprise\*\*. Leadership wanted deeper insights into churn after noticing rising cancellations and revenue loss.





The main objectives were:

\- Understand churn trends over time.

\- Quantify the financial impact of churn (MRR lost).

\- Identify which customer segments (by plan) churn the most.

\- Break down common reasons for churn.

\- Flag at-risk customers for proactive retention efforts.





This dashboard was built to serve as a decision-support tool for Customer Success and Growth teams.
