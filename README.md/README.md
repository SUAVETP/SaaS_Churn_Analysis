\# SaaS Churn Insights Dashboard



\## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a \*\*Power BI churn deep dive dashboard\*\* designed for a fictional SaaS company. It helps teams understand churn from multiple angles — not just \*what\* is happening, but also \*why\*. By combining quantitative metrics with customer-level breakdowns, SaaS teams can spot at-risk accounts, uncover churn drivers, and build stronger retention strategies.



The dashboard provides a structured way to answer questions such as:

\- What is our churn rate and how is it trending?

\- How much MRR are we losing to churn?

\- Which customer segments and plan tiers are leaving the most?

\- What reasons are customers giving for churning?

\- Which customers are at risk right now?
